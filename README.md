## How to run

1. First you need to install python(3.6 or above) and python virtual environment and create your own virtural environment (e.g. venv) under the project folder by typing "$ python -m venv venv".

2. Activate virtual environment by: Open the project folder in terminal, type"$ source ./venv/bin/activate". You may also do this via Python Ides(e.g. pycharm) by configging the interpreter as venv and the python inside the folder.

3. When you see "(venv)" in you command line, you can type"$ pip install -r requirements.txt" to install required libraries.

4. You can run server by typing:"$ python math-server.py" and open the link "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" in your browser

5. Use "ctrl+c" to stop the server and use "$ deactivate" to quit virtual environment
